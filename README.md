# Choose Your Adventure

- Clone the repo
- Create a new branch
- Create a new markdown file and add a new piece to the story. Keep it short.
- Choose an existing file (preferably one with no links yet). Add a link to your markdown file. The link should be a relative path.
```
this is going to take you to the [next story](./next_story.md)
```
- Commit your changes, push them to github and make a pull request to merge your branch to main.
- If you want to read the story, [start here](./start_here.md)
